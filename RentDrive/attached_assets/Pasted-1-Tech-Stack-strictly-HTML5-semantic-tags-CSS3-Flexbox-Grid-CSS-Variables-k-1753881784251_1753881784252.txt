1. Tech Stack (strictly):
   • HTML5 (semantic tags)  
   • CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables, @keyframes animations, glassmorphism, parallax scroll, full‑screen background images)  
   • Vanilla JavaScript ES6+ (modules, IntersectionObserver, Fetch API for static JSON, localStorage, modern JS patterns)  
   • No frameworks, no preprocessors, no build tools—just plain files.
